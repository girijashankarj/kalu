# 🐾 For Kalu

**For Kalu** is a personal, factual, and memorial website documenting the life of a dog named Kalu and the critical-care journey that followed his accident in December 2025.

This repository is not a product, service, or commercial initiative.  
It is a **public archive** created for remembrance, awareness, and preparedness.

---

## Purpose

This project exists to:

1. **Honor Kalu’s life** — his personality, habits, relationships, and role within our family.
2. **Document a real critical-care experience** — factually, chronologically, and without exaggeration.
3. **Help other pet parents prepare** — emotionally and practically — before emergencies remove choice.

The focus is **life first, tragedy second**.

## What This Project Is

- A **personal memoir** presented in structured, readable form  
- A **timeline-based documentation** of veterinary emergency care  
- A **reference archive** for pet parents navigating trauma, ICU systems, and medical decision-making  
- A **static informational website**, suitable for GitHub Pages  

---

## What This Project Is NOT

- ❌ Not a call for boycott or retaliation  
- ❌ Not a medical claim or clinical verdict  
- ❌ Not defamation or an accusation of intent  
- ❌ Not a replacement for professional veterinary advice  

All medical events are described **from the perspective of lived experience**, not as expert diagnosis.

---

## Scope of Content

The website includes:

- Kalu’s origin and early life (2016)
- His bond with family members
- Behavioral traits, habits, language recognition
- Major life phases (college years, COVID, marriage, relocation)
- The accident on 11 December 2025
- Emergency treatment and ICU journey (11–16 December 2025)
- Systemic challenges encountered during critical care
- Aftermath, grief, and rationale for public documentation

All content is arranged **chronologically** and **contextually**, not emotionally sensationalized.

---

## Ethical Position

We accept that Kalu may not have survived regardless of location.

The concern documented here is **not outcome**, but:
- communication
- preparedness
- empathy
- systemic bottlenecks in emergency veterinary care

Silence protects systems.  
Transparency protects people.
