# 🐾 Kalu – A Critical Care Experience Every Pet Parent Should Understand

This repository contains a **static public documentation website** that records the critical care journey of **our dog Kalu** between **13–16 December in Pune**.

The purpose of this project is **awareness, transparency, and preparedness** for pet parents — not blame, harassment, or allegations of medical negligence.

---

## 📌 Why this repository exists

When a pet is critically injured, families are often forced to make decisions under extreme stress, limited information, and time pressure.

In Pune, access to **advanced 24/7 veterinary critical care** is extremely limited. In emergency situations, pet parents are often directed to **a single option**, leaving them with **no meaningful alternative**.

This repository exists to:

- Document a **real, lived experience** in detail
- Help pet parents **understand systemic realities before an emergency**
- Encourage **better questions, preparedness, and expectations**
- Highlight how **processes, communication, and empathy** matter alongside medical skill

---

## ⚠️ Important clarification (please read)

- We **fully accept** that our dog Kalu was in a **critical, life-threatening condition**
- Survival was **never guaranteed**
- This project **does not allege medical negligence**
- This project **does not target individuals**
- This project **does not seek legal action**

We explicitly state that we have **no complaints** about the following doctors:
- **Dr. Leila Fernandez**
- **Dr. Phiroz Khambatta**
- **Dr. Muskan**

The concerns documented here relate to:
- System preparedness
- Infrastructure limitations
- Communication gaps
- Emotional support
- Availability dependencies
- Monopoly-driven constraints in emergency care
