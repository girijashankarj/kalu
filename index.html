          Kalu was in a critical, life-threatening condition; survival was not guaranteed. We accept that
          he may not have survived regardless of location. The concern documented here is not outcome, but
          communication, preparedness, empathy, and systemic bottlenecks in emergency veterinary care.

          This is not a call for boycott or retaliation. Not a medical claim or clinical verdict. Not

        <h3 class="title is-5">1.1 The Ordinary Night That Stopped Being Ordinary [Nov 2016]</h3>
        <p>I did not plan to bring a dog home that night. There was no thought of responsibility, no calculation of
          money, time, or future. I was not emotionally prepared for a life to depend on me. I was simply standing on a
          street, late at night, on a work call, trying to finish what the day demanded from me.</p>
        <p>That is how ordinary moments begin until they stop being ordinary.</p>
        <p>It was the last week of November 2016. The street was familiar. Nothing about the night felt special. Then I
          noticed movement that did not belong to the background noise of the city. A few dogs were circling something
          smaller. At first glance, it did not look dramatic. Dogs gather all the time. But this was different. Their
          movement was not playful. It was not curious. It was calculated. They were closing space, tightening distance,
          waiting for an opening.</p>
        <p>The puppy in the middle was small. Too small to defend himself, too small to understand what was happening.
          He was not barking. He was not running properly. He was frozen in confusion.</p>
        <p>I did not think. I did not weigh consequences. I picked him up.</p>
        <p>I continued my work call while holding him. The call lasted almost another hour. During that entire time, the
          puppy stayed with me, on my lap, climbing, licking, playing, as if he had already decided that this was safe
          now.</p>
        <p>The bigger dogs did not leave. They stayed at a distance, watching, waiting for me to move away, waiting for
          me to put the puppy down. That is when it became clear to me: If I walked away, even for a moment, the puppy
          would not survive the night.</p>
        <p>There was no dramatic rescue scene. No cheering. No help from anyone nearby. It was just a quiet decision
          made in the middle of a normal street.</p>
        <p>I brought the puppy into our society parking. I locked the gate. At that moment, I still believed this was
          temporary. I assumed that by morning, the puppy would go away on his own, find his way, disappear back into
          the randomness of the city. I went upstairs.</p>
        <p>That night passed without ceremony. No celebration. No naming. No declarations of forever. Just a puppy
          locked safely away from death.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">1.2 The Morning That Changed Everything [Nov 2016]</h3>
        <p>The next morning, I went down to the parking. I did not call his name. He did not have one yet. I made a
          small sound, instinctive, meaningless: "चुक चुक."</p>
        <p>From the first floor, I heard movement. The puppy came down the stairs. Not slowly. Not hesitantly. He ran.
          He ran as if he already knew me.</p>
        <p>I picked him up. He licked my ears. That was not affection learned over time. That was trust given instantly.
        </p>
        <p>In that moment, something irreversible happened, even if I did not yet understand it.</p>
        <p>I went upstairs and asked my father a simple question: "Should I keep him?"</p>
        <p>My father said yes. There was no long discussion. No list of reasons. No warnings. Just agreement. The puppy
          stayed.</p>
        <p>That puppy would later be called Kalu.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">1.3 The House He Walked Into [Nov 2016]</h3>
        <p>When Kalu entered our home, the house was already carrying weight.</p>
        <p>My father was not well, not temporarily, not mildly. Three years earlier, he had met with a serious accident
          on the Hadapsar bridge while riding a two-wheeler. The damage was neurological. One leg was partially
          paralysed. His vision was affected in both eyes. He could not see clearly anymore, not consistently, not
          reliably.</p>
        <p>This kind of injury does not announce itself loudly. It settles into daily life. Movement becomes cautious.
          Confidence becomes fragile. Independence slowly slips away.</p>
        <p>Our flat was on the ground floor, with a decent garden area. That garden became part of Kalu's early world,
          and also a quiet extension of my father's limited mobility.</p>
        <p>My sister and I went to college. We were away for long hours. During that time, my father stayed home alone.
          Not alone in the sense of absence of people, but alone in the sense that the world had become harder to
          navigate.</p>
        <p>Kalu grew up inside this environment. Not as a distraction. Not as entertainment. But as presence. He stayed
          close to my father without being taught to do so. He learned where to position himself so my father would not
          trip. He sensed when to move and when to stay still. He did not demand attention. He did not create chaos. He
          simply existed where he was needed.</p>
        <p>People in the society began to complain. Some people are genuinely scared of dogs. That fear is real, and I
          do not deny it. But many complaints came even when Kalu was not near anyone. Some people wanted trouble.
          Arguments happened. Stress increased.</p>
        <p>What those people never saw was what happened inside our home. Kalu was not adding burden. He was absorbing
          it. The house did not collapse during those months, not because life was easy, but because something steady
          stayed inside it.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">1.4 He Did Not Save Us, He Stabilised Us [2016]</h3>
        <p>Kalu did not cure my father. He did not fix paralysis. He did not restore vision. But he did something
          quieter and harder to notice. He made the house bearable. He occupied silence so it did not turn into despair.
          He became something predictable in a life that had lost predictability.</p>
        <p>At that time, none of us said this out loud. We did not know yet how important it was.</p>

        <h2 class="title is-3 chapter-title" data-chapter="Chapter 2">Learning to Live With Each Other [2016-2017]</h2>
        <h3 class="title is-5">2.1 Adjusting Without a Manual [2016-2017]</h3>
        <p>Kalu did not arrive as a trained dog. He arrived as a question.</p>
        <p>Every day after that morning in November 2016 became an adjustment, not just for him, but for us. There was
          no manual, no transition period where things slowly fell into place. Life continued at its pace, and Kalu
          learned to move inside it.</p>
        <p>Our flat was on the ground floor, with a garden that opened directly into the outside world. That garden
          became Kalu's first real territory. Not ownership, familiarity. He learned the smell of the soil. The pattern
          of birds. The timing of footsteps. The difference between morning quiet and evening noise. He learned without
          instruction.</p>
        <p>My sister and I were still going to college. Most of the day, the house belonged to my father and Kalu. This
          was not companionship in a dramatic sense. It was not playing all day or constant interaction. It was quieter
          than that.</p>
        <p>Kalu stayed close. He would lie where my father could sense him. Not necessarily touching, just present.
          Always within awareness. If my father shifted in his chair, Kalu shifted. If my father rested, Kalu settled.
          If my father moved slowly, Kalu gave him space. There was an intelligence in this that no one taught him.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">2.2 The Weight of Being Seen by Others [2016-2017]</h3>
        <p>Outside our home, Kalu's presence was not always welcomed. Some people in the society were scared of dogs. I
          understood that. Fear is instinctive, and it does not always need justification. But there were others who
          were not afraid, they were uncomfortable. Uncomfortable with a dog in shared space. Uncomfortable with a
          family already dealing with disability. Uncomfortable with something they could not control.</p>
        <p>Complaints started coming in. Not because Kalu had bitten anyone. Not because he chased or attacked.
          Sometimes he was not even near the people complaining. Arguments happened. Tension rose. It added another
          layer of stress to a house that already had enough.</p>
        <p>Kalu did not react to this chaos. He did not become aggressive. He did not grow anxious. If anything, he
          became more contained. He learned where to sit. Where not to cross. When to be visible and when to disappear
          into corners. He was not shrinking himself out of fear. He was adapting.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">2.3 Food, Routine, and Small Preferences [2016-2017]</h3>
        <p>Kalu's food was simple, almost basic. Milk. Chapati. Maida pav. Sugary things he should not have liked but
          did. Raw vegetables in his early days. There was nothing curated or fancy about his meals.</p>
        <p>He loved chicken tandoor from early on. That was obvious. But I am vegetarian, so he did not get it often.
          Mostly weekends. He accepted that without protest. Food never became a point of conflict. He ate what was
          given. He enjoyed what he could.</p>
        <p>Baths, however, were a different story. Kalu hated bath time. The word "अंघोळ" alone could change his mood.
          He resisted water when it was forced on him. He avoided tubs, buckets, and attempts to clean him on command.
        </p>
        <p>And yet, rain walks were his joy. When it rained, and we went out for a walk, he loved getting wet naturally.
          He enjoyed rain on his body when it was part of movement, freedom, choice. That contradiction stayed with him
          all his life.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">2.4 Freedom Without Chaos [2016-2017]</h3>
        <p>Kalu was never chained. He was never tied to one location. Never restricted to a corner.</p>
        <p>He moved freely inside the house and garden. Sometimes, when allowed, he went outside. There was an empty
          ground in front of our society then. He would go there, do his chores, and return on his own.</p>
        <p>No calling. No chasing.</p>
        <p>He learned the boundaries of home not through restriction, but through repetition. Later, he learned chain
          walking too. But that was a skill, not a requirement for obedience. He understood space intuitively.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">2.5 Language Before Commands [2016-2017]</h3>
        <p>Kalu did not learn English commands. He learned Marathi.</p>
        <p>He responded clearly to: "चला", "खायचे", "बाहेर जायचे". These were not commands shouted for control. They
          were shared language.</p>
        <p>Some words he disliked deeply. "अंघोळ". "Kame Hame Haa" - something I used to say playfully while shaking
          him, from Dragon Ball Z. "मारू का". "सरक".</p>
        <p>He reacted to tone, not just words. He understood intent.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">2.6 Rough Play and Honest Boundaries [2016-2017]</h3>
        <p>Kalu's play was not soft. He liked running behind us in the garden. Chasing legs. Jumping suddenly. Playing
          hide-and-seek. He did not care for toys. He ignored balls, ropes, anything artificial. He loved wooden sticks.
          He loved rugs, grabbing, pulling, testing strength.</p>
        <p>Sometimes play turned aggressive. Across his life, he bit only me, once or twice in those early meeting days,
          and later occasionally when play crossed a line or on days I still do not fully understand. I never hurt him.
        </p>
        <p>In his first two or three walks, I used a stick briefly for discipline. Not out of anger. Out of
          inexperience. He learned quickly. After that, we never needed it again. There was no pattern of fear. There
          was no cycle of violence. There was learning.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">2.7 The Quiet Bond That No One Noticed [2016-2017]</h3>
        <p>While all this was happening, college, complaints, routines, something deeper was forming quietly.</p>
        <p>Kalu was growing alongside my father. He was not replacing anyone. He was not filling a role. But when the
          house felt fragile, he stayed steady. When voices were low, he did not add noise. When days were heavy, he did
          not demand energy. He learned when to be visible and when to disappear into stillness.</p>
        <p>At the time, I did not fully see this. It only made sense later.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">2.8 June 2017 Came Without Warning [Jun 2017]</h3>
        <p>In June 2017, my father passed away. There was no gradual preparation for that loss. One day, he was there.
          The next, he was not.</p>

        <h2 class="title is-3 chapter-title" data-chapter="Chapter 3">After One Pillar Left, and Life Did Not Stop
          [2017-2019]</h2>
        <h3 class="title is-5">3.1 The House Without a Centre [2017-2019]</h3>
        <p>When my father passed away in June 2017, nothing announced itself loudly. There was no dramatic collapse of
          routine. No visible breaking point where the house fell apart. Life simply continued without him. That is what
          made it harder.</p>
        <p>The house did not scream. It went quiet. The kind of quiet that does not ask for attention but slowly takes
          up space.</p>
        <p>My sister and I were suddenly responsible for more than we were ready for. Responsibilities did not arrive in
          a list. They arrived as weight, distributed unevenly across days.</p>
        <p>By December 2017, my office life intensified. Longer hours. More pressure. Less presence at home. This was
          not a choice I debated emotionally. It was survival. Bills did not pause for grief. Work did not slow down
          because someone had died.</p>
        <p>Kalu adjusted again.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">3.2 Reduced Time, Increased Distance, Without Abandonment [2017-2019]</h3>
        <p>As my work hours increased, I spent less time at home. That guilt never left. It stayed in the background,
          never loud enough to paralyse me, but never quiet enough to ignore.</p>
        <p>Kalu did not react with resentment. He did not destroy things. He did not become needy. He did not withdraw.
          He simply recalibrated. He learned the rhythms of absence. He understood when mornings were rushed and
          evenings were exhausted. He adapted to the reality of someone coming home tired rather than available. This
          was not obedience. This was intelligence.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">3.3 Growing Without Guidance, Yet Not Lost [2017-2019]</h3>
        <p>Kalu was growing physically now. Stronger. More aware of his size. More confident in movement. He was not
          formally trained. There were no classes. No obedience drills.</p>
        <p>And yet, he learned boundaries. He learned which areas were his. Which were shared. Which required caution.
          He knew when to be visible and when to retreat into corners of familiarity. He remained free.</p>
        <p>He still went out occasionally on his own, did his chores, and came back. The empty ground in front of the
          society was still there then. He knew the route. He knew the return. There was trust both ways.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">3.4 Society, Again [2017-2019]</h3>
        <p>Complaints did not stop after my father's passing. In some ways, they increased. Perhaps because
          vulnerability invites scrutiny. Perhaps because a family without an elder becomes easier to pressure. Perhaps
          because people sensed there was less resistance.</p>
        <p>Arguments happened. Tension flared. Kalu remained unaffected. He did not react to raised voices. He did not
          mirror aggression. If anything, he became more observant. He started recognising not just people, but intent.
          He knew which footsteps were familiar. Which bikes belonged to people he trusted. Which voices signalled
          comfort.</p>
        <p>From inside the flat, he could correctly identify arrivals, friends, familiar visitors, family, before we
          opened the door. He would start wagging his tail early, certain of who was coming. This ability never felt
          like a trick. It felt like awareness sharpened by attention.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">3.5 A Brother, Not a Responsibility [2017-2019]</h3>
        <p>At some point during these years, something subtle but important shifted in me.</p>
        <p>I stopped thinking of Kalu as my dog. He became something closer to a brother. Not in sentiment, but in
          dynamic. We shared space without explanation. We coexisted without negotiation. We tolerated each other's
          moods. He did not demand affection. I did not perform care. We simply lived together.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">3.6 The Days That Were Just Days [2017-2019]</h3>
        <p>There were no major milestones during this period. No dramatic stories. No defining incidents. Just days.
          Days where Kalu slept in familiar spots. Days where he watched birds from the garden. Days where he chased
          cats along the wall. Days where he played rough, ran, stopped suddenly, lay down. Days where nothing happened
          and everything was stable.</p>
        <p>Looking back, these were the strongest years. Because nothing needed fixing.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">3.7 The Silence That Stayed [2017-2019]</h3>
        <p>Even as time moved forward, my father's absence did not fade. It became background. Not painful every moment.
          But present always.</p>
        <p>Kalu did not fill that absence. He acknowledged it. He lay in spaces my father used to occupy. He stayed near
          where silence felt heaviest. He did not replace anyone. He made it possible to live with the absence without
          being consumed by it.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">3.8 The World Was About to Change [Late 2019]</h3>
        <p>By late 2019, something else was approaching, something that would slow time for everyone. The world would
          pause. And for the first time in years, I would be home again, not out of choice, but circumstance.</p>
        <p>That is where Kalu's life entered its next phase.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="covid" class="box section-card">
        <h2 class="title is-3 chapter-title" data-chapter="Chapter 4">When the World Stopped, and Time Came Back
          [2019-2022]</h2>
        <h3 class="title is-5">4.1 Time Returned, But Not as Peace [2019-2022]</h3>
        <p>When COVID arrived, it did not knock. It shut doors. Offices closed. Roads emptied. Plans dissolved
          overnight. What had always felt permanent suddenly became uncertain. For the first time in years, the world
          slowed down, not by choice, but by force.</p>
        <p>And suddenly, I was home. Not for a weekend. Not for a few days. Every day. For a long time.</p>
        <p>At first, it did not feel like relief. There was anxiety everywhere. News. Numbers. Fear. Isolation. The
          house was quiet again, but this time it was a different kind of quiet.</p>
        <p>My friends started coming over once restrictions eased. Slowly. Carefully. They filled the house in a way it
          had not been filled since my father passed away.</p>
        <p>Kalu noticed immediately. He did not retreat from new presence. He did not become territorial. He observed.
        </p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">4.2 Kalu and People, Not Dogs [2019-2022]</h3>
        <p>Kalu had always preferred humans over dogs. That did not change. During this period, it became clearer.</p>
        <p>He did not rush toward people. He did not jump or demand affection. He watched first. Then he decided. Once
          accepted, he remembered.</p>
        <p>He remembered voices. Footsteps. The way people laughed. The way they sat. The way they moved around the
          house. He adjusted himself around them without being intrusive. Friends noticed this. "He understands," some
          of them said. And they were right.</p>
        <p>He did not seek constant interaction. He stayed nearby. Present, but not needy. When people sat, he sat. When
          conversations slowed, he settled. When laughter rose, he watched.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">4.3 The House Felt Alive Again [2019-2022]</h3>
        <p>For the first time since 2017, the house felt occupied, not just inhabited. Friends came and stayed longer.
          Meals stretched into conversations. Silence was shared instead of avoided.</p>
        <p>Kalu moved through this naturally. He did not guard. He did not withdraw. He flowed. If someone stayed
          overnight, Kalu knew. If someone left suddenly, Kalu noticed. He did not panic at change, he tracked it.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">4.4 Play, Roughness, and Familiar Chaos [2019-2022]</h3>
        <p>With more people around, play returned. Not structured play. Not planned. Spontaneous.</p>
        <p>Kalu ran behind legs in the garden. Chased us. Stopped suddenly. Changed direction without warning. He played
          hide-and-seek between trees, behind walls, behind furniture.</p>
        <p>Sometimes play turned rough. That had always been his style. He did not know gentle play the way toy-trained
          dogs do. He knew honest engagement. Strength testing. Presence testing.</p>
        <p>He never bit strangers. Never troubled kids. He tolerated crowds of 30 to 40 people, including small
          children, without aggression. He remained selective, but never unsafe.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">4.5 Learning Without Training [2019-2022]</h3>
        <p>This period highlighted something important. Kalu learned not because he was taught, but because he was
          observing constantly. He picked up routines. He knew when food was coming. He knew when night walks were
          likely. He knew when the house was settling down.</p>
        <p>Words mattered less than patterns. He understood Marathi cues naturally, but more than that, he understood
          context. Tone. Timing. Intent. That was his real language.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">4.6 Vehicles, Revisited [2019-2022]</h3>
        <p>Earlier attempts to train Kalu on two-wheelers had failed. We tried putting him on an Activa. He did not like
          it. He never learned. He resisted without panic, but with clarity. This was not fear. It was rejection.</p>
        <p>Later, with help from friends, we tried again, this time with the Maruti Alto. At first, he was hesitant. Not
          anxious. Not trembling. Just uncertain. We did not force it. Gradually, he sat. Then stayed. Then watched the
          road.</p>
        <p>Over time, he began tolerating car rides. Eventually, he began enjoying them. Not excitement. Comfort.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">4.7 Freedom, Still Intact [2019-2022]</h3>
        <p>Despite lockdowns and restrictions, Kalu's freedom was not crushed. He still moved between house and garden
          freely. He still chose where to sit. He still preferred clean places, bed, sofa, never mats. He still hated
          bath time. He still loved rain walks. Mud, garden digging, bird watching, nothing changed. The world outside
          was uncertain, but his world remained familiar.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">4.8 The Quiet Bond Strengthened [2019-2022]</h3>
        <p>During this phase, something else happened quietly. My bond with Kalu changed. Earlier years were about
          survival. Adjustment. Holding things together. Now, it was about presence.</p>
        <p>We were both there. Fully. Daily. No rushing out. No delayed returns. We shared space without urgency. He did
          not fill my time. He accompanied it.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">4.9 Nothing Felt Final Yet [2019-2022]</h3>
        <p>Looking back now, it is tempting to treat these years as a prelude. But at the time, there was no sense of
          before and after.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">5.1 The Return of Absence, But Different [2022-2025]</h3>
        <p>When the world began opening up after COVID, life did not return to what it was before. It rearranged itself.
          Work resumed. Movement returned. Days became structured again. The house that had been full during lockdown
          slowly returned to quieter rhythms.</p>
        <p>Kalu noticed this shift immediately. He always did.</p>
        <p>Earlier absences had felt heavy. They had carried grief. This time, absence felt more practical. People went
          out because life was moving again, not because something had been lost. Kalu adjusted without resistance. He
          no longer needed to hold the house together. He no longer needed to compensate for silence. He simply lived.
        </p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">5.2 February 2023, Marriage and a New Centre of Gravity [Feb 2023]</h3>
        <p>In February 2023, I got married. This was not a sudden event for Kalu. He had sensed change long before the
          wedding day arrived. He watched preparations. He noticed new routines. He felt shifts in attention, movement,
          and tone.</p>
        <p>When my wife entered the house fully, Kalu made a decision of his own. He chose her. Not gradually. Not
          hesitantly. Completely.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">5.3 The Mother-Son Bond [2023-2025]</h3>
        <p>Kalu's bond with my wife was different from his bond with anyone else. It was immediate, instinctive, and
          deeply emotional. He followed her everywhere. Room to room. Kitchen to bedroom. Inside to outside. He did not
          leave her alone. Not out of anxiety. Out of attachment. It was not dependency. It was belonging.</p>
        <p>If she sat, he sat nearby. If she moved, he followed. If she left the house, he waited differently. There was
          a tenderness in his behaviour that was unmistakable. It was a mother-son relationship. Pure. Unquestioned.
          Absolute.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">5.4 Where I Stood in That Shift [2023-2025]</h3>
        <p>For me, Kalu remained a brother. That did not change. But I watched his emotional centre move, and I did not
          resent it. I understood it.</p>
        <p>Kalu had always chosen the person who felt most constant in that phase of life. Earlier, that had been my
          father. Then the house itself. Then me, during lockdown. Now, it was my wife. This was not loss. It was
          growth.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">5.5 A Fuller Home, A Calmer Dog [2023-2025]</h3>
        <p>With marriage came a different kind of stability. The house felt occupied again, not by crowds, but by
          continuity.</p>
        <p>Kalu responded to this calm. He became more settled. More relaxed. More certain of routine. He still played
          rough. Still ran in the garden. Still chased cats. Still hated bath time. But there was less restlessness. He
          had found his person.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">5.6 Night Walks, His Greatest Joy [2022-2025]</h3>
        <p>Through all changes, one thing never shifted. Kalu loved night walks. Late nights. Quiet roads. Familiar
          smells. Sometimes with us. Sometimes alone. He would ask to go out after 9 PM, then again at 12 AM, sometimes
          even 3 AM. Short walks. Purposeful walks. He would go. He would return. Always.</p>
        <p>Those walks were not exercise. They were freedom rituals.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">5.7 The City Changed, Kalu Adapted [2022-2025]</h3>
        <p>As time passed, the empty ground near our society was built over. Space reduced. Kalu adapted again. He began
          walking almost 100 meters to the main road to do his chores, then returned home. No confusion. No getting
          lost. He knew his route.</p>
        <p>The city had changed around him, but he did not lose his sense of home.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">5.8 Comforts, Small and Personal [2022-2025]</h3>
        <p>Kalu's preferences remained simple. He still loved sugary treats, milky items, pedha. He still preferred
          sitting where we sat, bed or sofa, never mats. He still enjoyed rain walks while hating baths. He still
          rejected anything forced and accepted anything chosen.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">5.9 The New Car, The New Routine [2022-2025]</h3>
        <p>As my financial condition improved, I bought a new car. Kalu liked it. Not excitedly. Comfortably. He sat
          inside calmly. Observed. Trusted. It was another sign of stability, not indulgence.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">5.10 Health, Strength, and No Warnings [Early 2025]</h3>
        <p>By early 2025, Kalu was healthy. Alert. Strong. Aware. There were no signs of decline.</p>

      <section id="character" class="box section-card">
        <h2 class="title is-3 chapter-title" data-chapter="Chapter 6">Who Kalu Truly Was [2016-2025]</h2>
        <h3 class="title is-5">6.1 Awareness Before Action [2016-2025]</h3>
        <p>Kalu was not an easy dog. He was not predictable, obedient-for-approval, or eager to please. And that is
          exactly what made him real.</p>
        <p>He was intelligent, observant, selective, protective, and deeply aware of his surroundings. He did not exist
          to follow commands, he existed to participate in the world on his own terms.</p>
        <p>Kalu noticed things before reacting to them. From inside the flat, he could recognise specific bikes, cars,
          and voices. Many times, he would begin wagging his tail even before the door opened, already certain who was
          arriving. This was not excitement. It was recognition. He knew patterns. He remembered people.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">6.2 Welcome, With Responsibility [2016-2025]</h3>
        <p>Kalu was welcoming by default, but never careless. If the bell rang unexpectedly, especially delivery people
          or unfamiliar visitors, he barked. If unfamiliar dogs entered the parking area, he barked protectively.</p>
        <p>He did not bark without reason. And he did not bark endlessly. He assessed first. Then acted.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">6.3 Play That Was Honest, Not Polished [2016-2025]</h3>
        <p>Kalu's play style was rough and physical. He liked playing with legs, running behind us, jumping suddenly in
          mock aggression that was clearly play, until, at times, it crossed into intensity. He loved rug pulling,
          testing strength, resistance, reaction.</p>
        <p>He had no interest in toys. Balls, ropes, artificial playthings meant nothing to him. He preferred wooden
          sticks, simple, real, tactile.</p>
        <p>Throughout his life, he bit only me, hands, legs, thighs, sometimes even forehead. Mostly when play turned
          aggressive, sometimes without a clear reason. I never hurt him. This is written honestly, without
          justification or denial.</p>
        <p>In the first two or three walks of his life, I used a stick once for discipline. He learned quickly. We never
          needed it again.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">6.4 Selective With Dogs, Deep With Humans [2016-2025]</h3>
        <p>Kalu was slow to trust other dogs. He did not make friends easily. But he did have a few, Biscuit, Riya, and
          some others.</p>
        <p>With humans, he was different. He remembered people deeply, not casually. He recognised and remembered many,
          Swapnil, Mayur, Jayesh, Akshay, Aditya, Rakesh, Akash, Vishal, Jaywant, Tushar, Shruti, Vera, Shivani, and
          others. He did not just know them. He stored them.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">6.5 Space, Dirt, and Clean Choices [2016-2025]</h3>
        <p>Kalu loved mud. He played in it. He dug in the garden. And yet, he preferred clean places to sit. He never
          chose a mat. He chose the bed or sofa, wherever we were sitting. He wanted proximity, not comfort alone.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">6.6 The Garden Watcher [2016-2025]</h3>
        <p>One of Kalu's favourite things was sitting in the back garden. Watching birds. Tracking movement.</p>
        <p>When cats appeared on the garden wall, he reacted instantly, barking, chasing, alert and alive. This was not
          obsession. It was engagement.</p>
        <p>He used to enjoy back scratches and belly rubs from all humans.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">6.7 Language He Understood [2016-2025]</h3>
        <p>Kalu understood Marathi naturally, without training.</p>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Words he clearly understood:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>"चला" - let's go</li>
            <li>"खायचे" - hungry?</li>
            <li>"बाहेर जायचे" - want to go outside?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Words he clearly disliked:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>"अंघोळ" - bath</li>
            <li>"Kame Hame Haa" - from Dragon Ball Z</li>
            <li>"मारू का" - beat you</li>
            <li>"सरक" - move aside</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>He hated bath time, the idea, the word, the process. Yet he loved rain walks. He enjoyed getting wet by
          choice, outside, in motion.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">6.8 Night Walks, His Greatest Joy [2016-2025]</h3>
        <p>Kalu's greatest joy was going out at night. Sometimes with us. Sometimes alone. Late hours, 9 PM, 12 AM, even
          3 AM. He would go. He would return. Every time. Those walks were not routine. They were freedom rituals.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">6.9 Places He Visited, Memories Not Miles [2016-2025]</h3>
        <p>Kalu did not care about distance. He cared about presence. Places he visited and experienced:</p>
        <div class="content">
          <ul>
            <li>Lonavala</li>
            <li>Ghoradeshwar</li>
            <li>NH4 Highway</li>
            <li>Hinjewadi</li>
            <li>Ladhghar</li>
            <li>Datta Mandir, Kasarwadi</li>
            <li>Jambhulwadi</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>The place mattered less than being together.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">6.10 Small Moments That Defined Him [2016-2025]</h3>
        <p>Recognising our vehicles and voices from inside the flat. Sitting in the garden watching birds, reacting
          instantly to cats. Late-night walks, going out and returning on his own. Rough play that shifted naturally
          back to calm. Enjoying rain walks while still hating bath time.</p>

        <h2 class="title is-3 chapter-title" data-chapter="Chapter 7">The Night Everything Broke [11 Dec 2025]</h2>
        <h3 class="title is-5">7.1 Routine, Not Risk [11 Dec 2025]</h3>
        <p>The day of 11 December 2025 did not feel unusual. There were no signs. No strange behaviour. No instinct
          warning us to hold him back. Kalu ate. He rested. He moved around the house the way he always did. Night came
          the way it always had.</p>
        <p>Around 9:30 PM, Kalu asked to go out. This was normal. Night walks were his greatest joy. He did not rush. He
          did not sneak out. He asked through presence, movement, familiarity. We trusted that routine because it had
          never betrayed us before.</p>
        <p>He had done this countless times. He knew the route. He knew the return. We let him go. There was no sense of
          danger. No hesitation. Nothing felt wrong.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">7.2 The Call That Should Never Exist [11 Dec 2025]</h3>
        <p>Some time later, between 9:30 PM and 10:00 PM, my phone rang. An unknown number. I answered without urgency.
          The voice on the other side said something that took a moment to register: "कालू का एक्सिडेंट हुआ है।"</p>
        <p>For a second, it did not make sense. Accident was a word that belonged to roads, vehicles, strangers. Not to
          Kalu. Not to routine. Not to a night that had started normally.</p>
        <p>Then my body reacted before my mind did. I ran.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">7.3 The Place Where It All Began, Again [11 Dec 2025]</h3>
        <p>When we reached the spot, the first thing that hit me was recognition. This was the same place where I had
          found Kalu as a puppy in 2016. The same stretch. The same road. The beginning and the breaking happened at the
          same location.</p>
        <p>People were standing around. Around 20 to 30 people. They spoke in fragments. Someone said a biker hit him.
          Someone said the biker was drunk. Someone said the biker was speeding. They said the biker and another person
          fled. No one had stopped them. No one had taken Kalu to a hospital.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">7.4 The Moment of Absolute Helplessness [11 Dec 2025]</h3>
        <p>Kalu was lying there. No dramatic bleeding. No obvious wounds. But his body was wrong. His neck. His head.
          His eye. He was breathing, but not right.</p>
        <p>I asked people to help. I begged them to stop a rickshaw so my wife and I could take him to a hospital. No
          one helped. People looked. Some spoke. Some moved away. No one acted.</p>
        <p>That moment, standing there, surrounded by people, unable to move my injured dog, is one I will never forget.
        </p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">7.5 Bringing Him Home to Save Him [11 Dec 2025]</h3>
        <p>I ran back home. Took the car. Put Kalu inside. Every movement felt wrong. Every bump on the road felt like
          damage I could not see. We did not discuss where to go. We just went to the nearest place we knew could help.
        </p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">7.6 Petozone, Pimple Saudagar, The First Right Step [11 Dec 2025]</h3>
        <p>We reached Petozone, Pimple Saudagar between 10:00 PM and 11:00 PM. They examined him immediately.
          Externally, there were no major injuries. That almost gave false hope. Internally, they knew it was bad.</p>
        <p>They told us clearly: neck injury. Head trauma. Left eye damage. Possible spinal cord involvement.</p>
        <p>They did not waste time. They gave saline. They stabilised him as much as possible. They did not give false
          assurance. They told us the truth: "This is critical. He needs a 24/7 advanced hospital."</p>
        <p>We accepted that immediately. There was no argument. No denial. We were ready to fight.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">7.7 Searching for Care in the Middle of the Night [11 Dec 2025]</h3>
        <p>From that moment, the night became a series of refusals. We went to Crown Vet, Aundh. They refused us. Not
          after examination. Not after seeing Kalu. They did not come out. No doctor. No nurse. Only the watchman
          interacted with us, acting as a mediator between us and a building that had the lights on but the doors
          closed.</p>
        <p>That refusal stayed with me. Not because they could not help, but because they did not even look.</p>
        <p>From there, every call, every suggestion pointed to one place: "Raintree." "The best place." "The only
          place." "24/7."</p>
        <p>We called. First refusal, no occupancy. We went there personally. Second refusal, annual anniversary party. A
          celebration.</p>
        <p>We reached Vetic and were admitted between 11:30 PM and 12:00 AM.</p>

                  <span class="tag is-warning status-pill">Mixed</span>
                </div>
                <h4 class="title is-6">Our Account</h4>
                <p>12 December 2025 did not begin with panic. It began with hope under exhaustion.</p>
                <p>Kalu was still at Vetic. He was injured, severely, but he was alive. That single fact carried us
                  through the night and into the morning. We had not slept properly. We had slept in the car in
                  fragments.
                  Two hours here. Three hours there. But we were awake enough to notice something important. Kalu was
                  responding. He reacted to familiar voices. He lifted his ears. He tried to move. This was not
                  recovery,
                  but it was presence, and presence is all hope needs.</p>
                <p>The doctors at Vetic were clear and consistent. They did not sugar-coat anything. They did not speak
                  in
                  circles. They explained Kalu's condition in plain human language, not technical jargon. Someone was
                  continuously monitoring him. We could see that with our own eyes.</p>
                <p>Investigations were already done: X-rays, blood tests, monitoring. And we could also see the ceiling.
                  Vetic did not have MRI. They did not have certain advanced interventions. They told us this honestly.
                  That honesty mattered. But it also forced us into a corner.</p>
                <p>Every serious conversation that day eventually returned to one word: MRI. Not because MRI guarantees
                  survival. But because without it, no one could fully see what had been damaged, especially with
                  suspected neck, head, and spinal injury.</p>
                <p>And in Pune, MRI for animals meant something very specific. It meant one place. There were no
                  alternatives we could choose between. There was no comparison to make. The system narrowed to a single
                  path.</p>
                <p>On 12 December, we went personally to Raintree to request admission. Not to argue. Not to complain.
                  To
                  request. To explain. To ask them to take Kalu.</p>
                <p>We went there knowing fully that Kalu was in a fragile state, moving him carried risk, but staying
                  without MRI also carried risk. There was no good option. Only responsibility.</p>
                <p>That moment stays with me. Not because they refused. But because there was nowhere else to go. There
                  was no second advanced ICU. No backup MRI facility. The reality of monopoly became painfully clear,
                  not
                  as an idea, but as lived experience. When one door controls everything, refusal does not feel like a
                  decision. It feels like being stranded.</p>
                <p>We went back to Vetic. Kalu was still there. Alive. Fighting. We stayed near him. Watched him.
                  Waited.
                  We slept in the car again. The night of 12 December passed in suspension, not crisis, not calm. Just
                  waiting for morning.</p>
                <p>That night was not dramatic. No alarms. No rushing doctors. Just exhaustion. We kept asking ourselves
                  the same questions silently: Are we doing the right thing? Is moving him tomorrow safe? Is waiting
                  worse? There was no answer. Only time moving forward regardless of our uncertainty.</p>
                <p>We knew that 13 December would decide everything. If Raintree took Kalu, the fight would continue
                  inside that system. If they did not, we would be left with no escalation path at all.</p>
                <p>That night ended without resolution. But it ended with one plan: We would move Kalu on 13 December.
                  Not
                  because we were confident. But because there was no alternative left.</p>

                <h4 class="title is-6">Clinic Response</h4>
                <p>At Raintree, we were told that they could not take Kalu that day. The reasons communicated to us were
                  related to their anniversary event and operational constraints. We were told to come back the next
                  day.

                <h4 class="title is-6">Our Account</h4>
                <p>13 December 2025 began without rest. The night at Vetic had ended in fragments of sleep inside the
                  car,
                  not because we wanted to be close, but because going home felt wrong. Leaving Kalu behind, even for a
                  few hours, felt like abandonment, even though logic said otherwise.</p>
                <p>Morning came, and with it came the decision we had already made the night before. We would move Kalu.
                  Not because he was stable. Not because it was safe. But because staying meant accepting limits that
                  could cost him his life.</p>
                <p>Inside Vetic, the doctors explained again what we already knew. Kalu was fragile. Neck injury. Head
                  trauma. Possible spinal involvement. Movement itself was a risk.</p>
                <p>But they also knew what we knew. Without MRI, without advanced intervention, we were standing still
                  in
                  a situation that demanded motion. There was no drama in that conversation. Only gravity.</p>
                <p>When it was time to move Kalu, everything slowed down. Every touch mattered. Every lift felt
                  dangerous.
                  This was not just transferring a patient. This was transferring hope.</p>
                <p>We left Vetic knowing that, emotionally, we were leaving the place where we had felt the most clarity
                  and empathy since the accident. That hurt more than we expected.</p>
                <p>We left Vetic at 10:30 AM on 13 December and reached Raintree around 11:15 AM. When we reached
                  Raintree, Kalu was brought in. There was no stretcher. Despite clear neck and spinal injury, he was
                  lifted and carried by hand. That image stayed with me. Not because I expected luxury. But because
                  basic
                  caution mattered. CCTV would later show who carried him. But at that moment, there was no space to
                  argue. Only fear that another wrong movement could add damage we would never see.</p>
                <p>The admission wait continued around 11:30 AM.</p>
                <p>The first thing that shifted was not treatment. It was communication. At Vetic, doctors spoke to us
                  like people. At Raintree, the language became technical immediately. Medical terms. Short
                  explanations.
                  Assumptions of understanding. We kept asking for clarification. Sometimes we received it. Sometimes we
                  were left translating jargon into meaning ourselves. This was not hostility. But it was distance. And
                  distance matters when you are terrified.</p>
                <p>Very early on, we were told something that stayed with us. Kalu's condition was critical. The
                  injuries
                  were severe. Survival was not guaranteed. We accepted that. We never denied the seriousness. What we
                  struggled with was how that seriousness was communicated, more as data than as preparation.</p>
                <p>MRI did not happen immediately. Not because it was not needed. But because it depended on
                  availability,
                  specifically, the availability of an anaesthesia expert. Time passed. We waited. We followed up.
                  Finally, after 3:30 PM, things began to move. The MRI process was initiated.</p>
                <p>Consent for anaesthesia was taken on the spot. There was no long preparation. No gradual explanation
                  over the day.</p>
                <p>Kalu was taken for MRI. We waited outside. There is a particular kind of waiting that happens when
                  you
                  have no control, no information, and no alternative. This was that kind. Minutes stretched. Silence
                  felt
                  loud.</p>
                <p>When Kalu was brought back and anaesthesia was reversed, something unexpected happened. He responded.
                  He reacted to our voices. He lifted his head. He tried to stand. For a moment, just a moment, it felt
                  like something had shifted. Not recovery. But resilience. That moment mattered more than any report.
                  It
                  reminded us that Kalu was still present, still fighting, still connected.</p>
                <p>After MRI, permissions began coming in waves. More tests. Blood work. Tick fever testing from
                  Bangalore. Further monitoring. We did not hesitate. Money was never a discussion. We said yes to
                  everything. Even when they told us he might never walk again. We said yes. We accepted that future
                  without negotiation.</p>

                <h4 class="title is-6">Clinic Response</h4>
                <p>We were told clearly: "There is no guarantee he will survive MRI or anaesthesia."</p>

                <h4 class="title is-6">Our Clarification</h4>
                <p>That sentence did not come before the process was set in motion. It came inside it. We were given
                  very
                  little time to process it. But we agreed. Because MRI had become the gatekeeper for everything else.

                </div>
                <h4 class="title is-6">Our Account</h4>
                <p>We were home, but we were not present. Our bodies were inside the house, but our minds were still
                  inside the ICU.</p>
                <p>It was around 10:45 PM when the call came saying Kalu's condition was not good. We immediately said
                  we
                  would come. There was no hesitation. No discussion. We were told we could not. Visiting hours were
                  over.
                  The explanation was procedural, not medical. That distinction mattered more than anyone realised.</p>
                <p>We asked what "not good" meant. The answers were vague. Words like unstable, monitoring, critical
                  floated around without anchors. There was no clear picture, no step-by-step explanation of what had
                  changed since we last saw him at 8:30 PM. We asked if vitals were okay. We were told they were being
                  monitored. We asked again. We were told things were under control. That conversation ended without
                  clarity.</p>
                <p>Around 11:30 PM, we called again. The person on the phone, reception, told us: "Kalu is fine. Vitals
                  are normal." That sentence should have ended the anxiety. It did not. Because immediately after that
                  reassurance, we heard shouting in the background. Not raised voices in urgency. Shouting. We could
                  hear
                  staff arguing. We could hear panic. We could hear a machine making repeated beep-beep sounds. No one
                  muted the phone. No one ended the call. We heard everything.</p>
                <p>Through the noise, we caught fragments. Someone was shouting about a monitoring device not being
                  attached. There was argument over whose responsibility it was. Voices overlapped. No one was calm. And
                  then the call disconnected.</p>
                <p>For a few seconds, we sat frozen. Not because we did not understand what we heard. But because we
                  understood too many possibilities at once. Was that Kalu? Was his monitor disconnected? Was he the dog
                  collapsing in the background? Had we just heard the moment everything went wrong? There was no way to
                  know. And there was no one explaining.</p>
                <p>We called back immediately. No answer. We called again. No answer. The minutes stretched. Fear does
                  something strange at moments like this, it creates images you cannot stop. We did not imagine worst
                  cases. We imagined uncertainty.</p>

                <h4 class="title is-6">Clinic Response</h4>
                <p>At around 12:05 AM, someone finally answered. We asked directly about the shouting and the argument.
                  The response was simple: "That was another dog." No explanation. No context. No reassurance beyond the
                  sentence itself. We were told Kalu was okay. Vitals were fine. We asked again. We were told the same
                  thing.</p>

                <h4 class="title is-6">Our Clarification</h4>
                <p>We accepted the explanation because we had no choice. But one question stayed with us, unanswered. If
                  that was another dog, what happened to that dog? Did it survive? Did it collapse? Did it die? We were
                  never told. And that silence mattered.</p>
                <p>By that point, something had shifted inside us. Until then, we had trusted that whatever was
                  happening
                  inside the ICU was controlled, even if it was serious. After that call, trust became conditional. Not
                  because of intent. Not because of accusation. Because information had fractured.</p>
                <p>From that moment on, we started recording calls. Not to accuse. To protect ourselves from not
                  knowing.
                </p>
                <p>That night, sleep did not come. Not because we were waiting for a call. But because our minds were
                  replaying the same sounds. The shouting. The beeping. The abrupt silence. We lay there, counting
                  minutes, checking phones, imagining updates that never came. We were inside rules, but outside care.
                </p>
                <p>Eventually, the night thinned into morning. There was no closure to that call. No follow-up message.
                  No
                  proactive update.</p>

                <h4 class="title is-6">Our Account</h4>
                <p>Morning arrived, but it did not bring relief. It brought exposure. The kind that happens when you
                  finally see something in daylight that you were forced to imagine in the dark.</p>
                <p>We reached Raintree as early as we could. Not because we expected good news. But because we needed
                  confirmation. After a night filled with fragments, shouting, beeping, silence, seeing Kalu with our
                  own
                  eyes was the only thing that mattered.</p>
                <p>Visiting hours began. We were allowed in.</p>
                <p>Kalu was there. Alive. That alone steadied us for a moment. But his condition had changed. He looked
                  more tired. More withdrawn. His responses were slower. The spark we had seen after MRI the previous
                  evening felt dimmer. This was not sudden collapse. It was drift. The kind that happens when the body
                  is
                  fighting on too many fronts at once.</p>
                <p>We asked what had happened during the night. The answers came in pieces. No single explanation. No
                  clear timeline. Just reassurances layered over concern. Vitals. Monitoring. Stability. Words that
                  sound
                  safe, but do not explain progression.</p>
                <p>We asked about the shouting we heard on the call. The explanation remained the same: "It was another
                  dog." No additional detail. No acknowledgement of how terrifying that sounded to us as parents waiting
                  at home. The topic moved on quickly.</p>
                <p>As discussions continued, something else became clear. Most explanations were framed in technical
                  terms. Values. Indicators. Clinical phrasing. We tried to keep up. But when you are emotionally
                  exhausted, jargon becomes a barrier, not information.</p>
                <p>At one point, my sister asked about moving Kalu to another place. The response from the main doctor
                  that morning, Dr. Leila Fernandez, was restrained, almost detached. It was not hostility. It was
                  fatigue. She mentioned that moving him was possible, but she did not encourage it.</p>
                <p>I knew then that Kalu was not in a condition to be moved again. I said clearly that we would not be
                  taking him anywhere else. As his owner, that responsibility was mine.</p>
                <p>Later, after continued questions, the same doctor explained Kalu's condition again, this time in
                  simpler language. Not because the facts had changed. But because we needed meaning, not numbers. That
                  explanation brought brief relief. Not hope. Understanding.</p>
                <p>Around noon, the conversation shifted. Kalu had developed clotting issues. We were told he needed
                  fresh
                  plasma urgently. There was no delay in urgency. But there was delay in solution. We were told that we
                  would need to arrange a donor dog.</p>
                <p>The criteria were strict: vaccinated dog, weight 25 kg or more, no history of tick fever, not on
                  antibiotics or other medications. We did not have such a dog. The clinic's known donor dogs were
                  already
                  exhausted from previous donations. There was no blood bank to draw from. There was no ready plasma
                  available.</p>
                <p>What was urgent medically became logistically impossible.</p>
                <p>We stepped outside. Phones came out immediately. We started calling: friends, friends of friends,
                  NGOs,
                  WhatsApp groups, Instagram, Facebook. We posted messages everywhere. Time did not slow down for
                  effort.
                  The more urgent the need became, the more clearly we saw how fragile the system was. There was no
                  central coordination. No fallback. Just desperate outreach.</p>
                <p>Finally, a woman we had never met, Lady X, agreed to help. She was coming from far away with her dog.
                  That yes felt unreal. Relief mixed with fear. Would the dog meet criteria? Would the blood match?
                  Would
                  time run out before she arrived? We waited.</p>

                <p>We were told he needed fresh plasma urgently. We were told that we would need to arrange a donor dog.

                <h4 class="title is-6">Our Account</h4>
                <p>The morning of 15 December 2025 did not begin with questions. It began with fatigue. Not the kind
                  that
                  sleep fixes. The kind that settles into bones after days of alertness without rest.</p>
                <p>We reached Raintree again, carrying the weight of the previous night's pause. Lady X had already done
                  more than anyone could reasonably ask. And yet, everything still depended on what the system could do
                  next.</p>
                <p>We asked about the blood sample taken the previous night. The responses were unclear. Someone
                  mentioned
                  platelets. Someone mentioned mismatch. Someone said something did not align. There was no single
                  explanation that connected all the pieces. Information came indirectly, sometimes to my sister,
                  sometimes to us, and often without context. Confusion grew not because things were complex, but
                  because
                  they were not explained cleanly.</p>
                <p>Later that day, when Dr. Leila Fernandez reviewed the situation again, the message changed. We were
                  told that Lady X's dog was suitable, and that further blood extraction could proceed.</p>
                <p>The requirements were laid out clearly: the donor dog should be fasting, no food for 4 hours, no
                  water
                  for 2 hours before extraction. We contacted Lady X again. She was working. She rearranged her day. Her
                  husband helped. She came back. This mattered more to us than any protocol.</p>
                <p>Lady X's dog was sedated. Blood was extracted. We watched this with a mix of gratitude and fear.
                  Gratitude for a stranger's kindness. Fear that even this might not be enough.</p>
                <p>We asked repeatedly for the clinic to post donor requests on their own platforms. They did, but with
                  delay. By then, we had already mobilised on our own.</p>
                <p>As hours passed, it became clear that backup was necessary. If Lady X's blood did not work, there
                  would
                  be no time to start again. So we kept calling.</p>
                <p>By the end of the day, around 10 dogs were contacted or arranged. Some were physically brought. Some
                  sent samples via nearby clinics. Some did not meet weight criteria. Some did not match. Some were
                  ruled
                  out for medical reasons.</p>
                <p>This was not a process. It was crowdsourced survival.</p>
                <p>Lady X's dog's blood was extracted around 2:30 PM. The plan was plasma separation. But there was a
                  problem. There was no centrifuge available for plasma separation. We were told that natural separation
                  would be attempted, a process that takes hours.</p>
                <p>We waited. Time passed. After six hours, we were told that the natural process was not working.</p>
                <p>My wife has experience in pathology. She suggested finding an external centrifuge machine at a known
                  lab or blood bank to separate plasma. We raised this possibility. One of the main doctors acknowledged
                  that it could work. We started looking immediately. But time was slipping. The blood had been
                  extracted
                  at noon. The usable window was narrowing.</p>
                <p>Eventually, a decision was made. Instead of plasma alone, they would attempt a direct blood
                  transfusion. We agreed. At this point, agreement was not optimism. It was necessity.</p>
                <p>We were told the transfusion would take around four hours. We were told it would be stopped if Kalu's
                  temperature rose.</p>
                <p>At around 8:30 PM, the blood transfusion began. We waited. Every minute felt like negotiation with
                  fate.</p>
                <p>At around 10:30 PM, we were informed that Kalu's temperature had risen. The transfusion was stopped.
                  There was no argument. There was no protest. This was protocol. And protocol had now replaced hope.
                </p>
                <p>That night, the language shifted again. The tone became heavier. Words like poor prognosis began to
                  surface more openly. We were told that we might need to consider a final decision. We did not accept
                  that yet. Not because we were in denial. But because Kalu was still alive.</p>
                <p>By the end of 15 December, we were no longer fighting for recovery. We were fighting for time. Time
                  to
                  understand. Time to decide. Time to be present.</p>
                <p>We even discussed, quietly, the possibility of taking Kalu to his favourite place one last time
                  before
                  letting him go peacefully at a regular vet. That thought alone felt unbearable. But it entered the
                  room.
                </p>
                <p>Night fell without resolution.</p>

                <h4 class="title is-6">Clinic Response</h4>
                <p>We were told that Lady X's dog was suitable, and that further blood extraction could proceed. We were
                  told that natural separation would be attempted, a process that takes hours. After six hours, we were
                  told that the natural process was not working. We were told the transfusion would take around four
                  hours. We were told it would be stopped if Kalu's temperature rose. At around 10:30 PM, we were
                  informed
                  that Kalu's temperature had risen.</p>

                </div>
                <h4 class="title is-6">Our Account</h4>
                <p>The morning of 16 December 2025 arrived without negotiation. There was no sense of maybe today will
                  be
                  better. There was no false optimism left. There was only presence.</p>
                <p>When we reached Raintree that morning, Kalu was still alive. But his body was no longer holding
                  itself
                  together. The signs were visible, even before anyone explained them. His paws were swollen. His
                  abdomen
                  was distended. His urine was red, showing internal bleeding.</p>
                <p>We were told that his liver and kidneys were failing. The words multiple organ failure were no longer
                  implied, they were spoken. This was no longer about one injury. It was systemic.</p>
                <p>The staff adjusted his position. They spread his legs gently to help with breathing. They tried to
                  reduce pressure on his lungs and spine. This was not treatment anymore. This was comfort. And that
                  distinction was devastating.</p>
                <p>At some point that morning, the conversation everyone dreads entered the room. We were told that we
                  might need to consider letting Kalu go peacefully. Not as a recommendation framed gently over time,
                  but
                  as a possibility that had arrived suddenly.</p>
                <p>We listened. We did not argue. But we were not ready. Not because we did not understand the reality.
                  But because Kalu was still there. He was still breathing. He was still warm. He was still present. As
                  long as that was true, we wanted everything possible to be done. We said that clearly.</p>
                <p>Around 12:00 PM, Kalu stopped breathing. There was no warning alarm. No gradual slowdown. It happened
                  suddenly. One moment there was movement. The next, there was not.</p>
                <p>CPR was initiated immediately. Protocols were followed. Intubation. Chest compressions. Manual air
                  pumping with an ambu-bag. Kalu responded briefly. For a moment, it felt like he came back. That moment
                  gave false hope. Within 10 to 15 minutes, his body gave out again. This time, there was no return.</p>
                <p>I was watching his face. Not the monitors. His eyes did not move. His chest did not rise on its own.
                  There was no response, no reflex, no awareness. I said it out loud. "He is gone." I looked at the
                  assigned vet, Anushree, and said it again. She acknowledged it.</p>
                <p>And yet, the ambu-bag was still being pressed. Air was still being pushed into a body that had
                  already
                  let go. I asked her to stop. Only then was the bag removed.</p>
                <p>What followed was not immediate closure. Tubes were not removed right away. Monitoring equipment
                  stayed
                  attached longer than it should have. Kalu lay there, still connected, still medicalized, even though
                  life had already left. That image is difficult to erase.</p>
                <p>There was no preparation. No soft transition. No emotional grounding. No one spoke to us about what
                  would happen next. There was no moment of shared silence. Only procedure.</p>
                <p>We cleared the bills without dispute. Advance payments had already been taken daily. Money felt
                  irrelevant at that point. It was not about cost. It was about ending with dignity, and that had
                  already
                  passed.</p>
                <p>We took Kalu to the cremation facility near Naidu Hospital, Sangamwadi. We called everyone who loved
                  him. Friends. Family. Those who had known him as more than a dog. We performed the rituals. We stayed
                  until the end.</p>
                <p>When we returned home, the house felt unfamiliar. Not empty. Unrecognizable. No footsteps. No
                  movement.
                  No presence.</p>
                <p>Night came again. And for the first time in nine years, there was no reason to open the door after 9
                  PM. No night walk. No return.</p>
                <p>Kalu did not leave quietly. He fought. We fought with him. We accept that he may not have survived
                  anywhere. But survival is not the only measure of care. Empathy matters. Communication matters.
                  Preparedness matters. And when systems fail, the weight falls entirely on those who love.</p>
                <p>For Kalu.</p>

        <h2 class="title is-3 chapter-title" data-chapter="Chapter 9">What Stayed, What Broke, and Why This Exists [16
          Dec 2025]</h2>
        <h3 class="title is-5">14.1 The First Days After [16 Dec 2025]</h3>
        <p>After 16 December 2025, there was no next step. There was no treatment plan. No follow-up call. No "what
          happens now." There was only absence.</p>
        <p>The days immediately after Kalu's passing were not dramatic. They were empty. Not the kind of emptiness that
          screams, the kind that settles quietly into every corner of the house. Doors stayed closed longer. Lights
          stayed off more. Sounds felt unnecessary. Night came without purpose.</p>
        <p>For nine years, night had meant something. A walk. A return. Movement. Now it meant nothing.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">14.2 Grief Did Not Arrive All at Once [16 Dec 2025]</h3>
        <p>Grief came in fragments. Sometimes as anger. Sometimes as guilt. Sometimes as numbness. Not all at the
          hospital. Not all at the accident. Often at small, unexpected moments. Opening the door and expecting
          movement. Hearing a sound and turning instinctively. Reaching for a routine that no longer existed. Grief did
          not ask for permission.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">14.3 The Questions That Would Not Leave [16 Dec 2025]</h3>
        <p>With time, grief stopped being loud and became persistent. Questions surfaced, not because we wanted someone
          to blame, but because things did not add up.</p>
        <p>Why was there no stretcher? Why did availability matter more than urgency? Why was empathy absent when
          outcome was uncertain? Why did communication fail when clarity was most needed? Why did everything depend on
          one place, one system, one bottleneck?</p>
        <p>These were not questions asked in anger. They were questions asked because we did everything we were told to
          do. And still, we were left feeling uninformed, unprepared, and emotionally abandoned.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">14.4 Accepting the Outcome, Not the Experience [16 Dec 2025]</h3>
        <p>We accepted that Kalu may not have survived anywhere. That acceptance came early. What did not sit right was
          the experience. The lack of guidance. The lack of emotional preparation. The reliance on rigid systems during
          human moments.</p>
        <p>Critical care is not only about machines. It is about how people are treated when they are already breaking.
        </p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">14.5 Hearing Other Stories [16 Dec 2025]</h3>
        <p>In the days that followed, we spoke to other pet parents. Quietly. Privately. Some shared similar
          experiences. Some chose not to speak publicly. We do not speak on their behalf. But hearing them confirmed one
          thing: What we experienced was not isolated.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">14.6 Why We Chose to Write [16 Dec 2025]</h3>
        <p>This website, this archive, this record, it is not revenge. It is not an attack. It exists for three reasons:
        </p>
        <p>To honour Kalu's life, not just his death.</p>
        <p>To document a real critical-care journey, without exaggeration.</p>
        <p>To help other pet parents prepare, emotionally and practically, before emergencies happen.</p>
        <p>Silence protects systems. Truth protects people.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">14.7 What This Is, and What It Is Not [16 Dec 2025]</h3>
        <p>This is not a call to boycott. Not a demand for punishment. Not a denial of medical complexity.</p>
        <p>It is a request for better communication, better empathy, better preparedness, better alternatives in a city
          that deserves more than one option, especially when lives depend on it.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">14.8 Responsibility Without Regret [16 Dec 2025]</h3>
        <p>We do not regret fighting. We do not regret spending. We do not regret insisting. We would do it all again.
          Because Kalu fought. And when someone you love is fighting, you do not calculate outcomes, you show up.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">14.9 Kalu's Legacy [16 Dec 2025]</h3>
        <p>Kalu's life was not defined by his end. He lived freely. He loved deeply. He adapted constantly. He held a
          family together when it was fragile. He chose people when it mattered. He trusted us with his life.</p>
        <p>This archive exists because that trust deserves respect.</p>

        <h3 class="title is-5">14.10 If You Are Reading This as a Pet Parent [16 Dec 2025]</h3>
        <p>Please understand this: emergencies remove choice. Systems matter. Preparation matters. Ask questions before
          you need answers. Know your options before panic narrows them. Demand clarity before exhaustion takes it away.
          And never feel ashamed for asking for empathy.</p>
        <p>For Kalu.</p>
        <p>Kalu was not perfect. He was not easy. He was not replaceable. He was family. A small brother. A constant
          presence. A life that mattered. This is for him.</p>

        <p>Kalu was not a case. He was not a patient. He was family.</p>
        <p>He lived freely. He loved deeply. He adapted constantly. He held a family together when it was fragile. He
          chose people when it mattered. He trusted us with his life.</p>
        <p>He fought. We fought with him. We accept that he may not have survived anywhere. But survival is not the only
          measure of care. Empathy matters. Communication matters. Preparedness matters.</p>
        <p>Kalu was a small brother. A constant presence. A life that mattered. Never forgotten.</p>
        <p>— For Kalu 🐾</p>
