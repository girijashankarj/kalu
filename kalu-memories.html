            <p>
                Kalu, our indie dog, looked like a Border Collie and found us on 26 Nov 2016 on the road near our house.
            </p>
            <p>
                He was a charming, smart boy — always understanding, never troubled, never broke anything. He understood
                more than 40–50 Marathi words and was closely attached to our family.
            </p>
            <p>
                We never chained him because we had a big flat and a big garden space behind. He never asked for dog
                food.
                He liked milk, bread, and chicken tandoor on weekends, and recently started enjoying Drools and
                Choco-cos,
                but he was never demanding.
            </p>
            <p>
                We went through many difficult situations at home, including financial issues — he was always emotional
                support and truly a family member.
            </p>
            <p>
                We never liked bikes or mopeds, but recently he started enjoying car rides. He was ready whenever we
                took
                car keys for office, and we used to give him small rides or take him to multiple places.
            </p>
            <p>
                It felt like he started enjoying freedom due to our new car and the stability we recently got.
            </p>
            <p>
                He recently celebrated his 9th birthday on 26 Nov at Ladghar Beach. It was my dad’s wish to take him to
                the beach; even though he was scared of water (even for bath), he enjoyed the beach and the vibes.
            </p>
            <p class="font-semibold">
                But the day of the accident came on 11 Dec.
            </p>
            <p>
                As usual we left him for walk as daily routine — he goes, takes his walk and comes back. But this day
                was
                different. I received a call from a friend about his accident by drunk drivers on two wheelers. They
                flew away.
                We took Kalu to Petozone, then Vetic Kalyani Nagar, then Raintree, Ghorpadi.

            <p>
                Kalu had no external wounds, but major internal injuries involving the head, neck, left eye, spinal
                cord,
                lungs, liver, kidneys, bladder, and internal bleeding. We fully accept his condition was critical and
                life-threatening.
            </p>
            <p>
                On 11 December, a friend called us about his accident. It was caused by drunk drivers on two wheelers
                who fled the spot.
            </p>
            <p>
                Initial stabilization was done at Petozone Clinic, Pimple Saudagar, and we were advised to move to a
                24/7
                advanced hospital.
            </p>
            <p>
                Crown Vet, Aundh, did not even come out to see our dog. Only a watchman interacted with us as a
                mediator.
            </p>
            <p>
                Multiple vets told us Raintree is the only place in Pune with advanced facilities like MRI and 24/7 ICU.
                We reached Raintree because there was no real choice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our dog was admitted to Vetic, Kalyani Nagar for two days (11–12 December). They did immediate treatment
                like X-ray and blood tests. We saw some improvement, but they did not have next-level treatment like
                lung
                fluid removal and MRI. We had to sleep in the car and barely got 2–3 hours of rest.
                The doctors there were empathic, explained things in normal words, and kept continued monitoring by
                one person near our dog.
            </p>
            <p>
                On 12 December, we personally approached Raintree for emergency admission. First we were told there was
                no occupancy. Later, we were refused due to their annual anniversary event. This was the first major red
                flag.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Day 1 – 13 December (Admission & MRI)</h2>
            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Admission & handling</h3>
            <p>Our dog Kalu was admitted on 13 December at Raintree.</p>
            <p>Despite neck and spinal injuries, no stretcher was used. He was lifted by hand, which risked further
                damage.</p>
            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">MRI & anesthesia</h3>
            <p>MRI urgency was not taken up immediately. It happened only after repeated follow-ups and when the
                anesthesia expert was available.</p>
            <p>The MRI was scheduled after around 3:30 PM because the anesthesia expert was available only then.</p>
            <p>Consent for anesthesia was taken on the spot, without proper prior explanation.</p>
            <p>We were informed after sedation that there was no guarantee Kalu would survive anesthesia.</p>
            <p>MRI and anesthesia were handled by Dr. Muskan.</p>
            <p>Raintree used a nearby MRI center within about 1 km of the hospital.</p>
            <p>After reversal, Kalu responded to us, lifted his ears, opened his eyes, and tried to stand. We felt hope.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">After MRI</h3>
            <p>We agreed to every test, without thinking about money.</p>
            <p>We were told Kalu may never walk again, and we accepted full responsibility for lifelong care.</p>
            <p>Tick fever tests were sent outside Pune.</p>

        <div class="p-6 bg-white rounded-2xl memorial-card">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Night of 13 December – Serious trust-breaking moment</h2>
            <p>We left around 10:00 PM after seeing Kalu responsive and alert.</p>
            <p>At 10:45 PM, we received a call saying his condition was not good.</p>
            <p>We offered to come immediately, but we were told we are not allowed to see him due to visiting-hour
                rules.</p>
            <p>Later that night, we were told Kalu was stable.</p>
            <p>During the same phone call, we clearly heard shouting, alarms, and staff arguing about monitoring
                equipment not being attached to a dog.</p>
            <p>The call ended suddenly.</p>
            <p>We recorded the call because we were becoming suspicious about the handling.</p>
            <p>Later, we were told it was “some other dog”.</p>
            <p>At 12:05 AM our calls were not picked. When they finally responded, they said our dog was okay.</p>
            <p>As dog parents, hearing this while our own dog was critical was terrifying and disturbing.</p>
            <p>We still do not know which dog it was or what happened.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="p-6 bg-white rounded-2xl memorial-card">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Day 2 – 14 December (Blood & plasma crisis)</h2>
            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Communication & empathy</h3>
            <p>Most explanations were given in technical medical language.</p>
            <p>Only when Dr. Leila Fernandez explained in simple words did we clearly understand Kalu’s condition.</p>
            <p>The assigned vet Anushree showed no empathy, no emotional support, and constant negativity.</p>
            <p>In Marathi: “चेहऱ्यावरची माशी पण उडत नव्हती.”</p>
            <p>We were told we could move Kalu elsewhere, but he was not in a condition to travel long distance.</p>
            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Plasma emergency</h3>
            <p>Kalu urgently required fresh plasma due to clotting issues.</p>
            <p>Raintree had no plasma separation centrifuge and no blood bank support.</p>
            <p>We were told to arrange donor dogs ourselves with strict criteria.</p>
            <p>Criteria: vaccinated, 25 kg+, no history of tick fever, and no antibiotics or ongoing medication.</p>
            <p>We contacted NGOs, friends, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook groups.</p>
            <p>Lady X, a complete stranger, came from far with her dog purely out of kindness.</p>
            <p>Even then, sampling was delayed and cross-matching was pushed to the next morning due to lab
                availability.</p>
            <p>We asked the hospital to share a donor post on their page; it was posted only after a delay.</p>
            <p>This was emotionally and physically draining for a family already breaking down.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="p-6 bg-white rounded-2xl memorial-card">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Day 3 – 15 December (MRI report delay & transfusion)</h2>
            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">MRI report delay</h3>
            <p>MRI report was not shared because the neurologist was unavailable.</p>
            <p>Only after Tata Small Animals Hospital, Mumbai, contacted the same doctor on our behalf did the report
                arrive.</p>
            <p>Until then, information was unclear and incomplete.</p>
            <p>Reports on the Vet Buddy portal were also delayed; we had to request uploads repeatedly.</p>
            <p>This made us feel that external pressure was needed to receive basic medical clarity.</p>
            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Blood transfusion</h3>
            <p>Plasma separation failed due to lack of equipment.</p>
            <p>Lady X’s dog was kept fasting (food for 4 hours, water for 2 hours) before blood extraction.</p>
            <p>The collected blood was kept for natural plasma separation, but it did not work in time.</p>
            <p>We searched for a centrifuge option; Dr. Khambta said it could work, but time was running out.</p>
            <p>The plan changed to direct blood transfusion.</p>
            <p>We were told Kalu had liver and kidney issues, bladder urine was red due to internal injuries, and his
                paws were swelling.</p>
            <p>We had arranged nearly 10 dogs; some didn’t match, some didn’t fit weight criteria.</p>
            <p>Some people offered to send blood samples through porter and dunzo with ice packs.</p>
            <p>Transfusion was stopped midway as Kalu’s temperature increased.</p>
            <p>We were told it would take 4 hours, and they would stop if his temperature rose. It was stopped after
                about 30 minutes.</p>

        <div class="p-6 bg-white rounded-2xl memorial-card">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Day 4 – 16 December (Kalu passed away)</h2>
            <p>Kalu stopped breathing around 12 PM.</p>
            <p>CPR was attempted.</p>
            <p>Even after clear signs that he was gone, manual air pumping continued, which was extremely distressing to
                witness as pet parents.</p>
            <p>We asked them to stop the air pumping. The balloon-like tube was removed later, but other monitoring
                equipment was not removed immediately.</p>
            <p>We had been asked for daily advance payments of 25k; the bill was always above that amount.</p>
            <p>We cleared all bills without any argument.</p>
            <p>We took Kalu for cremation near Naidu Hospital, Sangamwadi, called his loved ones, performed our rituals,
                and said our final goodbye.</p>

                We accept that our dog Kalu may not have survived anywhere.

            <p class="mb-4">
                We were ready to fight for him with time, effort, and money, without hesitation.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                But how a dog is handled, spoken about, and supported while fighting for life matters deeply.
                Empathy, clear communication, preparedness, and honest guidance matter — especially when a hospital
                holds a monopoly and pet parents have no alternative.
